# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features of cell nuclei present in breast mass. The dataset is sourced from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which includes 33 attributes representing different characteristics of the cell nuclei.
